TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a fundamental communication
protocol in computer networks. Operating at the transport layer,
TCP ensures reliable and ordered data delivery between devices over a
network. It establishes a connection before data exchange, uses
acknowledgments and retransmissions for reliability, incorporates
flow control to manage data flow, and guarantees the correct order
of data delivery. TCP is crucial for applications requiring accuracy,
such as web browsing, email, and file transfer. It works alongside the
Internet Protocol (IP) in the TCP/IPprotocol suite, forming the basis
 for internet communication.
